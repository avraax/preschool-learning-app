# 🚀 Manual Deployment Guide

This project has been configured for **manual-only deployments** to give you full control over when updates go live.

## 📋 Quick Deployment

### Option 1: Use the Deployment Scripts
```powershell
# PowerShell script (recommended)
.\deploy-production.ps1

# Or batch file
.\deploy-production.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual Commands
```powershell
# Build and deploy in one go
npm run build && npx vercel --prod

# Or step by step
npm run build
npx vercel --prod
```

## 🔧 What Was Changed

### ✅ Removed Automatic GitHub Deployments:
- Deleted `.vercel/` configuration folder
- Added `git.deploymentEnabled: false` to `vercel.json`
- GitHub pushes no longer trigger automatic deployments

### ✅ Added Manual Deployment Tools:
- `deploy-production.ps1` - PowerShell deployment script
- `deploy-production.bat` - Batch file deployment script
- This documentation file

## 🎯 Deployment Workflow

1. **Make your changes** and test locally with `npm run dev`
2. **Commit and push** to GitHub (for version control only)
3. **Run deployment script** when ready to go live:
   ```powershell
   .\deploy-production.ps1
   ```
4. **Verify deployment** at https://preschool-learning-app.vercel.app/

## 📱 Complete Manual Control

### Benefits:
- ✅ **No surprise deployments** - only deploy when YOU decide
- ✅ **Test thoroughly** before going live
- ✅ **Deploy on your schedule** - perfect for educational content
- ✅ **Version control** - GitHub still tracks your changes
- ✅ **Zero caching issues** - each deployment is fresh

### Production URL:
**https://preschool-learning-app.vercel.app/**

## 🔍 Vercel Dashboard Steps (Manual - One Time)

To complete the disconnection, you'll need to manually:

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your `preschool-learning-app` project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Git**
4. Click **"Disconnect"** next to your GitHub repository
5. Confirm the disconnection

After this, only manual deployments with `npx vercel --prod` will work.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If you get "Project not found":
1. Run `npx vercel link` to reconnect (but not to GitHub)
2. Choose your existing project when prompted

### If deployment fails:
1. Check that `npm run build` works locally
2. Ensure you're logged into Vercel: `npx vercel login`
3. Verify project exists in Vercel dashboard
