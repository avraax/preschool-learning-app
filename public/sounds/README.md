# Sound Assets for Balloon Demos

This directory contains sound files used in the balloon pop demos.

## Required Sound Files:

- `sharp-pop-328170.mp3` - Sharp popping sound

## Note:
Currently using placeholder files. Replace with actual audio files in production.
The SoundManager component will gracefully handle missing files by falling back to silent operation.
